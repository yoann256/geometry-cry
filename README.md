A bad fanmade recreation of Geometry Dash by RobTop.

## Todo

- [ ] Add an editor
- [ ] Fix some bugs
- [ ] Add more levels

## Credits
Most code come from me, some assets like icons come from RobTop, check the original game at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robtopx.geometryjump.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute, try to keep the same code format as mine and the same scene naming scheme.\
When adding texture, use the Atlas Merging Tool in Godot to add your textures in the spritesheet.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not put game textures (e.g. the play button texture) in GCSpritesheet1.png, either create another spritesheet, or just use the texture directly with no spritesheet. (recommended)
